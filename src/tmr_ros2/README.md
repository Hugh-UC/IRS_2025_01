# Omron ARM package

To view the original Readme.md [click here](./docs/README.md)

This package is a combination of documentation from [OmronAPAC/Omron_TM_ROS2](https://github.com/OmronAPAC/Omron_TM_ROS2) and functionality of [TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2)

View [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/omron_arm/blob/humble/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc).

## Setup

Create a workspace

```sh
mkdir -p omron_ws/src
cd omron_ws/src
```

Install dependencies
```sh
sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit ros-humble-controller-manager ros-humble-joint-trajectory-controller ros-humble-joint-state-broadcaster ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui ros-humble-vision-opencv
```

Clone the repositories into the `src` folder by

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/omron_arm.git
```

Build by

```sh
cd ..
colcon build
```

## Usage 

### Initialization

1. [Startup TMFLow software with a listener node](https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/omron_arm/blob/humble/docs/README.md#-tmflow-listen-node-setup)

2. [Establish Remote connection to TM Robot](https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/omron_arm/blob/humble/docs/README.md#-remote-connection-to-tm-robot)

3. Once the robot starts up, it needs to have the listner node loaded (via TMFlow) and should be in the auto mode. On the arm it needs to flash blue and red, while on the pendent a blue light should appear near letter A.

4. If it is in manual mode (arm blinking green and pendent has a yellow light near letter M), press `M/A` button few seconds until the yellow button near M letter starts blinking and quickly enter the password (+-++-) on the pendent using pendent `+` and `-` keys.

### Connect directly to the arm

Run the following command to connect to robot. Replace the `<robot_ip_address>` with actual ip address.

```sh
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver robot_ip:=<robot_ip_address>
```

### TM Robot Arm with Moveit (Simulation)

TM driver node is included in the tm12x_run_move_group.launch.py file.
```sh
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch tm12x_moveit_config tm12x_run_move_group.launch.py
```

### TM Robot Arm with Moveit 

TM driver node is included in the tm12x_run_move_group.launch.py file. Replace the `<robot_ip_address>` with actual ip address.
```sh
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch tm12x_moveit_config tm12x_run_move_group.launch.py robot_ip:=<robot_ip_address>
```

### TM Robot Arm with Moveit (Headless Companion Computer Configuration)

1. TM driver node is included in the tm12x_run_move_group.launch.py file. To start the headless moveit server, uncomment the following line on the companion computer

    ```yaml
    command:
    - ros2 launch tm12x_moveit_config tm12x_run_move_group_headless.launch.py robot_ip:=<robot_ip_address>
    ```

    and run

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

2. On the remote computer run the following command,
    ```sh
    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch tm12x_moveit_config tm12x_run_move_group_visualize.launch.py
    ```
