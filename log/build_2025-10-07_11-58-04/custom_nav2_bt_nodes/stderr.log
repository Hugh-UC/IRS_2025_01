[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindBehaviors_cpp_v3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Behaviors_cpp_v3", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Behaviors_cpp_v3"
  with any of the following names:

    Behaviors_cpp_v3Config.cmake
    behaviors_cpp_v3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Behaviors_cpp_v3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "Behaviors_cpp_v3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "Behaviors_cpp_v3" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
